	<li>Interacting with installed applications through <a href="plugins.php">plugins</a>.</li>

					<h2>Find and Do</h3> 
	    			Quicksilver gives you quick access to all your important things. With only a few keystrokes, you can get to your applications, files, contacts, bookmarks, music, etc. Don&#8217;t get distracted though; although Quicksilver finds and launches things quickly and extremely well, it's more about <em>doing</em>, not finding. <br />

					<h2>Launch that thing</h3> 
					<p>Want to start Mail.app? Type &#8220;mail&#8221; and press return. Too much typing? Then type &#8220;m&#8221; and select Mail.app from the list of results. Quicksilver learns your abbreviations as you use them. <br />
	    			This isn&#8217;t limited to applications. It applies to anything in Quicksilver&#8217;s catalog: contacts, documents, bookmarks, music and more.</p>				</div>

					<h2>Launching is a gateway drug</h3> 
    				Saying that Quicksilver is an application launcher is like saying a car is a drinks holder. You can do almost anything with Quicksilver. Quicksilver's art is in learning what you like doing, and turning your chores into two-second thoughts. By knowing your habits, Quicksilver blurs the line between thinking about something and simply getting it done.<br />

	    				<img class="Screenshot" style="width:270px" src="Images/why_abbreviations.png" title="Flexible abbreviations" alt="Abbreviating results in Quicksilver"/> 
				
	    			<h2>Type it like you think it</h3> 
	    			Using OS X's Spotlight or a similar app to find the contact 'John Smith' requires you to search for say &#8220;john&#8221;. What if you want to just type &#8220;js&#8221;? Quicksilver lets you abbreviate using letters from anywhere in the name, and that means anywhere. Use &#8220;ps&#8221; to find Photoshop or &#8220;tun&#8221; to find iTunes. <br />Use abbreviations that make sense to you.<br />

					<h2>Do it like you think it</h3> 
	    			Quicksilver lets you do things how you think of them, adapting to however you think.
	<br />You can Google search for 'some text', or find 'some text' with Google search.<br /> 
<br />
	    			You can select a contact and e-mail them a file, or you can select a file and e-mail it to a contact.<br />
	    			No thinking. No planning. No adjusting. Just doing. <br />

	    				<img class="Screenshot" src="Images/why_stay.png" title="No need to switch apps" alt="Perform everything from Quicksilver"/> 
				
	    			<h2>Stay where you are</h3> 
	    			With Quicksilver, you never need to stop what you&#8217;re doing to complete simple tasks. Move the file you just downloaded to your Documents folder without leaving your browser. Add something to your To Do List as soon as you think of it. Quicksilver allows you to process your thoughts instantly, and lets you get right back to what you want to be doing. <br />

						<img class="Screenshot" src="Images/why_grab.png" title="Grab the selection from any app" alt="Grab results from any application into Quicksilver"/> 
    			
					<h2>Grab and go</h3> 
	    			Select files or text and act upon them immediately. Quicksilver can grab the current selection from almost any application. Grab selected text to search for it on the web or append it to a file. Grab files and delete them, move them or send them. Grab pictures to resize them or change their format (above), the options are limitless.<br />

						<img class="Screenshot" src="Images/why_files.png" title="Manage files" alt="Copy a file using Quicksilver"/> 
				
	    			<h2>Keep Finder at arm&#8217;s length</h3> 
	    			Quicksilver allows you to do all sorts of things with files: move, copy, rename, delete, whilst also letting you navigate your entire file system. Just add a few important top-level folders to the catalog and you can browse through your folders from there.<br /> 
					<br />

					<h2>Still not fast enough?</h3> 
	    			If you find yourself doing something frequently, you can <strong>speed up the task</strong> even further by assigning a &#8220;trigger&#8221; to it. Triggers give you the power to assign regular tasks to keyboard shortcuts or mouse movements; you don't even need to activate Quicksilver.<br />

						<img class="Bordered-Screenshot" style="margin-bottom:20px" src="Images/why_plug-ins.png" title="Add functionality" alt="Extend Quicksilver with plugins"/> 
				
					 <h2>Extend Quicksilver &amp; do more</h3> 
	    			There are <a href="http://qsapp.com/wiki/Plugin_Reference">many plug-ins</a> that extend Quicksilver's functionality even further. Interact with your installed applications; Mail, 1Password, Microsoft Office and more. Access information from web-based services. Access your browser&#8217;s bookmarks and history. <br />

				<a name="spotlight"></a>
	    			Spotlight is fantastic and it certainly has its place, but it&#8217;s no substitute for Quicksilver. 
	    			<ul> 
	      			<li>Spotlight knows about <b>everything</b> on your Mac. Quicksilver also knows about everything, but concentrates on the things you care about.</li> 
	      			<li>Spotlight is about finding things. Quicksilver is about finding things (faster) then <em>doing something</em> with what you&#8217;ve found.</li> 
	      			<li>Spotlight can show your dad&#8217;s entry in the Address Book. Quicksilver can show your dad&#8217;s work phone number, call it or send your dad a file.</li> 
	      			<li>Spotlight forces you to think as you search. Quicksilver allows you to just start typing to get what you want.</li>
