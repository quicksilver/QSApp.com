    "paragraph1": "Both Quicksilver and Alfred are keyboard-driven productivity apps for macOS that help you launch applications, find files, and automate tasks. Alfred launched in 2010 and has become popular for its polished interface and workflow system.",
    "paragraph2": "Quicksilver pioneered this category back in 2003 and takes a fundamentally different approach: while Alfred focuses on <em>finding</em> things, Quicksilver focuses on <em>doing</em> things. Its noun-verb-object model lets you chain actions together fluidly—and every feature ships free and open source."
